## **Executive Summary**



## **Data and Observations**

* Data Source:  [Kaggle Data Source](https://www.kaggle.com/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions?select=RAW_interactions.csv)

* Cleaning: Data was clean in the sense that it had a uniform format to it but there were some aspects that needed to be changed and updated.  Initially the nutrition information was all in the same column, this made it hard to read so these things were split into their own columns. 

* Dictionary:

| Name | Data Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| Name | string | name of recipe |
| Minutes | integer | Duration of the cooking recipe |
| Tags| string, list | popular categories helping to identify the recipe |
| n_steps | integer | total number of steps in the recipe |
| steps | string, list | the actual steps to completing the recipe |
| description | string | written out subjective description of dish |
| ingredients | string, list | list of specific items needed to complete the dish |
| n_ingredients | integer | total number of individual ingredients |
| calories | float | caloric total for the dish |
| tot_fat | float | total amount in grams |
| protein | float | total amount in grams  |

## **Methods**
* Models:  For models I focused on clustering, this ideally would create smaller subsets of the data that would have better results when asked for recommendations.  
* Limitations 
* Conclusion
